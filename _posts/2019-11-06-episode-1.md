### What is the Infusing Computing webseries?

Welcome to episode one of the Infusing Computing webseries.

In these episodes we will share guidance from our NSF-funded research program which focuses on embedding computational thinking into middle school and high school classrooms.

The webseries will include four types of episodes:

Infusing Computational Thinking: This is a deep dive into what is computational thinking (CT), and how to embed it in instruction.
Water Cooler: This is a behind the scenes look at the project as we share news, notes, and insight for project participants.
Focus On The Content Area: This is a look at connecting with CT from a disciplinary perspective.
Report From The Field: This is a talk with a classroom teacher that is currently trying to embed CT in their classroom.
All episodes are meant to be quick (under 10 minutes) and to the point.
